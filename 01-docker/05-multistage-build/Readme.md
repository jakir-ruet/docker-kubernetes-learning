#### Welcome to Docker Multi Stage Build
[Multi Stage Build](https://docs.docker.com/build/guide/multi-stage/)
Multi-stage builds are useful to anyone who has struggled to optimize Dockerfiles while keeping them easy to read and maintain.

**Use multi-stage builds**
Actually, executing the application only needs the runtime, not the base image. Suppose we want to run a .net/python application then we need only a .net/python runtime. But in Docker creating images we need base images such as 'Ubuntu Image, Apt, Yum' & other repositories. For this reason, image memory is more than runtime that way it will be slow work and more memory consumption.

With multi-stage builds, you use multiple `FROM` statements in your Dockerfile. Each `FROM` instruction can use a different base, and ***each of them begins a new stage*** of the build. You can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you don't want in the final image. There are two main reasons for why youâ€™d want to use multi-stage builds: 
- They allow you to run build steps in parallel, making your build pipeline faster and more efficient.
- They allow you to create a final image with a smaller footprint, containing only what's needed to run your program.

The following Dockerfile has two separate stages: one for building a binary, and another where the binary gets copied from the first stage into the next stage.

#### Let's see hand on

Application Test
```bash
go build main.go
./main
```

Build as base image
```bash
# BASE IMAGE BUILD
FROM ubuntu AS build
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install golang-go -y
ENV GO111MODULE=off
COPY . .
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o /app .
ENTRYPOINT [ "/app" ]
```

Build & check memory
```bash
docker build -t go-app-multi .
docker images | head -4
```

Build as multi stage
```bash
# BASE IMAGE BUILD
FROM ubuntu AS build
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install golang-go -y
ENV GO111MODULE=off
COPY . .
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o /app .

# MULTI STAGE BUILD
FROM scratch
# COPY THE COMPILED BINARY FROM BUILD STAGE
COPY --from=build /app /app
# SET ENTRYPOINT FOR CONTAINER TO RUN
ENTRYPOINT [ "/app" ]
```

Build & check memory
```bash
docker build -t go-app .
docker images | head -4
```

Push to Docker Hub
```bash
docker build -t jakirbd/docker-compress-app .
docker run -p --name docker-compress-app -d jakirbd/docker-compress-app:latest
docker push jakirbd/docker-compress-app
```
